2. NOT AUTHENTICATED:
   → Redirect to /welcome
   → User sees branded landing page
   → Google Sign-In button available
   → No navbar visible

3. AUTHENTICATED (first time):
   → Check if quiz completed (chronotype exists in Firestore)
   → IF NO chronotype:
     → Redirect to /quiz
     → User takes quiz
     → Results saved to Firestore
     → Redirect to /assistant (as per quiz page flow)
   
4. AUTHENTICATED (returning user):
   → IF chronotype EXISTS:
     → Allow access to home page
     → Show feature cards
     → Full navbar visible
