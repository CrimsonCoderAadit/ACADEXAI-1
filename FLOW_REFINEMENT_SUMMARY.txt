CHANGES MADE
================================================================================

### 1. POST-QUIZ FLOW (ISSUE RESOLVED)

**File:** app/quiz/page.tsx

BEFORE:
- Quiz results screen had 2 buttons: "AI Assistant" + "Take Quiz Again"
- Auto-redirected to home after 3 seconds (first-time users)
- Unclear navigation options

AFTER:
- Quiz results screen now has 3 buttons:
  ✅ "Go to Home" (with home icon)
  ✅ "AI Assistant" (with lightbulb icon)
  ✅ "Take Quiz Again" (with refresh icon)
- Removed auto-redirect logic
- User has full control over next destination
- Navbar is visible on results screen

**Lines modified:**
- Removed: Lines 158-163 (auto-redirect setTimeout logic)
- Updated: Lines 197-227 (three-button layout with icons)
- Removed: isFirstTimeQuiz state variable and router import (unused)

---

### 2. NAVBAR VISIBILITY (CORRECTED)

**File:** components/NavigationWrapper.tsx

BEHAVIOR:
- Navbar hidden ONLY during first-time quiz (when quizCompleted === false)
- Once quiz is completed, navbar is ALWAYS visible
